The difference between volume type mount and bind
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44290211/docker-compose-v3-the-difference-between-volume-type-mount-and-bind

bind is the simpler one to understand. It takes a host path, say /data and mounts it inside your container, say /opt/app/data. 
/data can be anything, probably mounted on NFS or it maybe a local host path. 

$ docker run -v /data:/opt/app/data -d nginx

volume mount is where you can use a *named volume*.

You would normally use a volume driver for this, but you can get a host 
mounted path using the default local volume driver something like the below:


$ docker volume create data
$ docker run -d -v data:/opt/app/data nginx

The named volume can also be anonymous if you run just this: 

$ docker run -d -v /opt/app/data nginx

If you run `$ docker volume ls`, docker would have create an autogenerated long name for the anonymous volume.

In docker-compose, you would just use it as below:

```
web:
  image: nginx:latest
  volumes:
    /data:/opt/app/data
    data:/opt/app/data1

volumes:
  data:
```
